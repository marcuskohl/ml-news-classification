Enhanced News Classification Project

**Overview**
This project develops a machine learning model capable of classifying news articles as real or fake. Leveraging a substantial dataset from Kaggle, the model aims to address the critical issue of misinformation in media.

**Dataset**
The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle: Fake News Classification Dataset. Please download the dataset directly from Kaggle to ensure you have the most recent version.

**Features**
- Text Preprocessing: Uses advanced text processing techniques, including tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming, to prepare the data for analysis.
- Machine Learning Model: Uses a Logistic Regression model fine-tuned to accurately distinguish between real and fabricated news stories.

**Prerequisites**

- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NLTK, scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE

**How to Use**

- Clone the repository to your local machine
- Navigate to the project directory and run the Jupyter Notebook
- Open 'news_classifier.ipynb' and execute to run the model
